# alpaca-docs

Developer documentation for Alpaca API's.

## Requirements

- [Hugo v0.91.2-extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.91.2)

## Build

To build the site, run `hugo` in the root directory. You should have the built site in `public` directory.

## Live preview

Run `hugo serve` and it should spin up a local server with the site.

## Contributing

If you find a discrepancy with documentation, a typo or simply some new section to add or improve you can clone the docs and add contribute.

1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-docs.git`

2. Make changes and preview with `hugo serve`. Hugo has autoreload capabilities so as you change you should see things get refreshed.
