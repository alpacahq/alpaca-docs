    Announcement:
      description: |-
        The announcements endpoint contains public information on previous and upcoming dividends, mergers, spinoffs, and stock splits.

        Announcement data is made available through the API as soon as it is ingested by Alpaca, which is typically the following trading day after the declaration date. This provides insight into future account stock position and cash balance changes that will take effect on an announcement’s payable date. Additionally, viewing previous announcement details can improve bookkeeping and reconciling previous account cash and position changes.

        Announcements have both a type and a subtype to categorize them. This model represents the lowever level abstract "sub types" of Announcement. Please see the AnnouncementCAType model for higher level descriptions of the possible types

        Possible values are:

        - from the `dividend` type:
          - **cash**

            A cash payment based on the number of shares the account holds on the record date.
          - **stock**

        - from the `merger` type:
          - **merger_update**

            An update to the terms of an upcoming merger. This can happen any number of times before the merger is completed and can be tracked by using the id parameter.

          - **merger_completion**

            A final update in the terms of the merger in which the intiating_symbol will acquire the target_symbol. Any previous terms updates for this announcement will have the same id value.

        - from the `split` type:
          - **stock_split**

            An increase in the number of shares outstanding with a decrease in the dollar value of each share. The new_rate and old_rate parameters will be returned in order to derive the ratio of the split
          - **until_split**

            An increase in the number of shares outstanding with a decrease in the dollar value of each share. The new_rate and old_rate parameters will be returned in order to derive the ratio of the split.
          - **reverse_split**

        Create a new transfer to an account to fund it.

        In the sandbox environment, you can instantly deposit to or withdraw from an account with a virtual money amount. In the production environment, this endpoint is used only for requesting an outgoing (withdrawal) wire transfer at this moment. For the wire transfer (in production), you need to create a bank resource first using the Bank API. For more on how to fund an account in sandbox please check out this tutorial [here](https://alpaca.markets/learn/fund-broker-api/).

        Notes:
        * Pagination is handled using the `page_token` and `page_size` parameters.
        * `page_token` represents the ID of the end of your current page of results.
          for example if in your first response the id of the last Activiy item returned in the array was `20220203000000000::045b3b8d-c566-4bef-b741-2bf598dd6ae7`, you'd pass that value as `page_token` to get the next page of results

        * If specified with a `direction` of `desc`, for example, the results will end before the activity with the specified ID.
        * If specified with a `direction` of `asc`, results will begin with the activity immediately after the one specified.
        * `page_size` is the maximum number of entries to return in the response.
        * If `date` is not specified, the default and maximum value is 100.
        * If `date` is specified, the default behavior is to return all results, and there is no maximum page size.

      description: |-
        Replaces a single order with updated parameters. Each parameter overrides the corresponding attribute of the existing order. The other attributes remain the same as the existing order.

        A success return code from a replaced order does NOT guarantee the existing open order has been replaced. If the existing open order is filled before the replacing (new) order reaches the execution venue, the replacing (new) order is rejected, and these events are sent in the trade_updates stream channel found [here in the market data api](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-references/market-data-api/#order-updates).

        While an order is being replaced, the account's buying power is reduced by the larger of the two orders that have been placed (the old order being replaced, and the newly placed order to replace it). If you are replacing a buy entry order with a higher limit price than the original order, the buying power is calculated based on the newly placed order. If you are replacing it with a lower limit price, the buying power is calculated based on the old order.

        Note for people using the clients generated from this OAS spec. Currently OAS-3 doesn't have full support for representing SSE style responses from an API, so if you are using a generated client and don't specify a `since` and `until` there is a good chance the generated clients will hang waiting for the response to end.

        If you require the streaming capabilities we recommend not using the generated clients for this specific usecase until the OAS-3 standards come to a consensus on how to represent this correcting in OAS-3.

        The Events API provides event push as well as historical queries via SSE (server sent events).

        You can listen to transfer status updates as they get processed by our backoffice, for both end-user and firm accounts.

        Historical events are streamed immediately if queried, and updates are pushed as events occur.

        Query Params Rules:
        - `since` required if `until` specified
        - `since_id` required if `until_id` specified
        - `since` and `since_id` can’t be used at the same time
        Behavior:
        - if `since` or `since_id` not specified this will not return any historic data
        - if `until` or `until_id` reached stream will end (status 200)

        ---

        Note for people using the clients generated from this OAS spec. Currently OAS-3 doesn't have full support for representing SSE style responses from an API, so if you are using a generated client and don't specify a `since` and `until` there is a good chance the generated clients will hang waiting for the response to end.

        If you require the streaming capabilities we recommend not using the generated clients for this specific usecase until the OAS-3 standards come to a consensus on how to represent this correcting in OAS-3.
