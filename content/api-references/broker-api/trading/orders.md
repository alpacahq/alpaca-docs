# Orders

The Orders API allows you to monitor, place and cancel your end user order requests. Each order has a unique identifier (`client_order_id`) that could be provided by you. This client-side unique order ID will be automatically generated by the system if not provided by the client, and will be returned as part of the order object along with the rest of the fields described below.

Once an order is placed, it can be queried using the `client_order_id` or `order_id` to check the status. Updates on open orders at Alpaca will also be sent over the streaming interface found [here]({{< relref "../events/#trade-updates" >}}), which is the recommended method of maintaining order state.

Less common states are described below. Note that these states only occur on very rare occasions, and most orders will likely never reach these states:

| Status                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accepted`             | The order has been received by Alpaca, but hasn’t yet been routed to the execution venue. This could be seen often outside of trading session hours.                                 |
| `pending_new`          | The order has been received by Alpaca, and routed to the exchanges, but has not yet been accepted for execution. This state only occurs on rare occasions.                            |
| `accepted_for_bidding` | The order has been received by exchanges, and is evaluated for pricing. This state only occurs on rare occasions.                                                                     |
| `stopped`              | The order has been stopped, and a trade is guaranteed for the order, usually at a stated price or better, but has not yet occurred. This state only occurs on rare occasions.         |
| `rejected`             | The order has been rejected, and no further updates will occur for the order. This state occurs on rare occasions and may occur based on various conditions decided by the exchanges. |
| `suspended`            | The order has been suspended, and is not eligible for trading. This state only occurs on rare occasions.                                                                              |
| `calculated`           | The order has been completed for the day (either `filled` or `done_for_day`), but remaining settlement calculations are still pending. This state only occurs on rare occasions.      |

An order may be canceled through the API up until the point it reaches a state of either `filled`, `canceled`, or `expired`.

### Fractional Trading

All correspondent accounts at Alpaca have fractional trading enabled by default. You can now allow your users to participate in fractional trading in two ways:

1. Inputting a fractional amount in `qty`
2. Inputting a notional amount in the `notional` field of the POST request body

### Passing Commissions

If you want to collect commissions on trades requested by your users you can simply pass in the POST request body a **dollar** amount in a string in the `commissions` field.

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "qty": "4.125",
  "side": "buy",
  "type": "market",
  "time_in_force": "day",
  "commission": "1"
}

## **Estimating an Order**

`POST /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/estimation`

Order estimation endpoint will display, based on user's account balance, the estimated quantity and price they will receive for their notional order.

For LCT - customer's order will include the Alpaca `swap_fee`, while correspondent side `swap_fee` is configurable in the API call. Utilising this API does not result in a real order and after the calculation - the user's buying power reverts to the previous state.

Responses and Errors are the same as with the Orders API

Please note that the estimation is based on the market condition at the time of submission and a live order will differ. The output should be considered indicative.

{{<hint info>}}
Note: This does not support Crypto or non-market orders at this time.

## **Patching an Order**

`PATCH /v1/trading/accounts/{account_id}/orders/{order_id}`

Replaces a single order with updated parameters. Each parameter overrides the corresponding attribute of the existing order. The other attributes remain the same as the existing order.

A success return code from a replaced order does NOT guarantee the existing open order has been replaced. If the existing open order is filled before the replacing (new) order reaches the execution venue, the replacing (new) order is rejected, and these events are sent in the `trade_updates` stream channel found [here](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/streaming/#order-updates).

While an order is being replaced, buying power is reduced by the larger of the two orders that have been placed (the old order being replaced, and the newly placed order to replace it). If you are replacing a buy entry order with a higher limit price than the original order, the buying power is calculated based on the newly placed order. If you are replacing it with a lower limit price, the buying power is calculated based on the old order.

### Request
