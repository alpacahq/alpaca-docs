# Stock Pricing API

### **Data Sources**

Alpaca provides market data from two data sources:

**1. IEX (Investors Exchange LLC) which accounts for ~2.5% market volume**

- IEX is optimal to start testing out your app and utilize it where visualizing accurate price information may not take precedence.

**2. All US exchanges which account for 100% market volume**

- This Alpaca data feed is coming as direct feed from exchanges consolidated by the Securities Information Processors (SIPs). These link the U.S. markets by processing and consolidating all bid/ask quotes and trades from every trading venue into a single, easily consumed data feed.

- We provide ultra low latency and high reliability as the data comes directly into Alpaca's bare metal servers located in New Jersey sitting next to most of the market participants.

- SIP data is great for creating your trading app where accurate price information is essential for traders and internal use.
