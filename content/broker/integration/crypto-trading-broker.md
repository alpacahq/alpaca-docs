# Crypto for Broker API

Alpaca supports crypto trading 24 hours a day, every day. Crypto is available for testing in sandbox, in case you want to allow your users to trade crypto please reach out to the Sales or Developer Success team.

Crypto trading is currently available for eligible international participants and participants in all US jurisdictions with the exception of New York. 

## Enabling Crypto

To enable crypto trading for an account, the crypto agreements must be signed by the user. All account balances will represent the crypto trading activities. 

In the case of new users, the crypto agreement can be submitted via the Accounts API where `crypto_agreement` is part of the agreements attribute.

*Part of the request*
```json
{
    "agreements": [
        {
        "agreement": "crypto_agreement",
        "signed_at": "2021-09-11T18:09:33Z",
        }
    ]
}
```

In the case of existing users the account has to be updated with the `crypto_agreement` which can be submitted on the `PATCH /v1/accounts/{account_id}` endpoint.


*Request*
```json
{
  "agreements": [
    {
      "agreement": "crypto_agreement",
      "signed_at": "2021-10-11T18:13:44Z",
      "ip_address": "185.13.21.99"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once the crypto agreement is added to the user account no further edits can be made to the agreements.

To determine whether the account is all set to start trading crypto, use the `crypto_status` attribute from the Account API endpoint response object.

*Response example*
```json
{
  "id": "9feee08f-22d2-4804-89c1-bf01166aad52",
  "account_number": "943690069",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "crypto_status": "ACTIVE",
}
```


**Crypto Status**

| Attribute             | Description                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `INACTIVE`            | Account not enabled to trade crypto live              |
| `ACTIVE`              | Crypto account is active and can start trading        |
| `SUBMISSION_FAILED`   | Account submissions has failed                        |



## Supported Assets

The number of supported cryptocurrencies is above 20 on the Alpaca platform. We
constantly evaluate the list and aim to to grow the number of supported
currencies.

{{< hint warning >}}
**New Trading Pairs for Brokers coming soon!**  

We are rolling out crypto trading pairs which will allow your users to trade additional crypto assets with `BTC` and `USDT` as base assets on top of the current default `USD` pairs. The largest impact this new trading feature brings to brokers is a change in crypto pair symbol convention. For example, `BTCUSD` would now be represented as `BTC/USD`.

Changes have been made to APIs to be backwards compatible with the old representation of crypto symbols (e.g. `BTCUSD`). This should minimize disruption for any brokers not actively looking to support new pairs. Should you encounter any problems due to this change please reach out to support.

If your interested in rolling out new crypto trading pairs and want to enale on your environment reach out to support.

For more information on enabling new crypto pairs, see [Migration Steps]({{< relref "##migrating-to-new-crypto-pairs" >}}).

**Note: By end of Semptember, all brokers will be asked to change to the new symbology convention as this will be the default for crypto trading.**

{{< /hint >}}

Tradable cryptocurrencies can be identified through the [Assets API]({{<relref "../../api-references/broker-api/assets">}}) where the asset entity has `class = crypto` and `tradable = true`.

```json
{
    "id": "64bbff51-59d6-4b3c-9351-13ad85e3c752",
    "class": "crypto",
    "exchange": "FTXU",
    "symbol": "BTCUSD",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "status": "active",
    "tradable": true,
    "marginable": false,
    "shortable": false,
    "easy_to_borrow": false,
    "fractionable": true
}
```

Please note that the symbol appears with `USD`, such as `BTCUSD` instead of `BTC`.

All cryptocurrency assets are fractionable but the supported decimal points vary depending on the cryptocurrency.

## Migrating to New Crypto Pairs

We are in the process of enabling new assets for brokers in the form of crypto pairs. This will enable brokers to execute trades to the traditional USD pairs and the new non-USD pairs. Prior to this change we only supported.

**Deadline to migrate to new crypto pairs is September 31st!** After this date we will switch all brokers to leverage new crypto pairs symbology. We highly recommend you switch prior to this date to avoid any unforeseen problems. We will enable crypto pairs on sandbox by defualt during migration period in preparation to move to the new pairs and symbology by default. Here are some steps to take care of during migration:


1. New symbology: Once crypto pairs are enabled [Assets API]({{<relref "../../api-references/broker-api/assets">}}) (`/v1/assets`) will start returning crypto assets with new symbology. For example, `BTCUSD` would now be returned as `BTC/USD` where we now separete the base and quote currencies.
2. Start consuming [crypto market data from `v1beta2` endpoints]({{<relref "../../api-references/market-data-api/crypto-pricing-data/historical.md">}}): Traditionally, brokers have been consuming crypto data from `v1beta1`, you will need to change to new market data endpoints to be able to consume data for pairs with new symbology. This includes both historical and real-time data. 
3. When submitting orders, you can contunue using old symbology as we have made this backwards compatible. However, we encourage changing order submission to use new symbology.
4. For positions, these will remain with the same symbology. This does not change as most crypto assets are quoted in `USD`.
5. For new crypto pairs, fees would be collected in quoted crypto assets. For example, a buy or sell of `ETH/BTC` would incur in a `BTC` fee collected as this is the quote currency/asset. For current pairs, such as `BTC/USD`, the collected fee would be in `USD` which is how this has typically worked.

{{<hint info>}}
**Reconciliation with new symbology**

Some brokers might leverage activities with current positions to do some form of reconciliation. Take note that positions will continue to use old symbology, such as `BTCUSD`, while activities will use new crypto pairs convention `BTC/USD`.

If you system previosly matched positions, with activities or other sources of information such as orders these migth cause problem and we encourage to do a broad sweep of these to make sure all is handled correctly with this new migration.
{{</hint>}}

{{<hint warning>}}
**Crypto Fee Revenue Notice**
If you enable non-USD crypto trading you will receive fees in the quote currency. Currently, non-USD quote crypto assets are `BTC` and `USDT`. As a broker business you would need to be ready to handle collecting crypto fees plus taking care of the necessary conversions if needed.
{{</hint>}}

### Crypto Pairs API Changes

With the introduction of crypto pairs some APIs have changed how certain fields return data, particularly the symbol key which will now include a forward slash (`/`) such as `BTC/USD`.

Below we go over some API examples of how things changed or reamined the same and explain why.

#### Assets API

Generally, the largest change with pairs have been the introduction of the the forward slash in the `symbol` field of the asset.

Additionally, the crypto asset `name` field has also change the naming convention given its now a pair of two assets.

    "price_increment": "1"
}
```
{{< /columns >}}

#### Orders API

For Orders API, you can now submit crypto orders to a crypto pair. You can still submit order to the typical `USD` pair, and the new `BTC` and `USDT` pairs.

You can also continue submitting order with older symbology (e.g. `BTCUSD`) as we have made this backwards compatible. However, we encourage you to update API submission to use new symbology.

Below some examples of submitting a `BTC` order using the old and new symbol convention.


{{< columns >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

##### Old Order Style

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "qty": "0.0001",
  "side": "buy",
  "type": "market",

  "qty": "0.0001",
  "side": "buy",
  "type": "market",
  "time_in_force": "gtc"
}
```

{{</ columns >}} <!-- begin columns block -->


Note that the response object for orders will return the new pairs `symbol` convetion. Regardless if you submit an order using old symbology, the Order API response will return new symbology in the response payload.

```

#### Positions API

Positions were not impacted by the introduction of crypto pairs. Lets say you acquired a `BTC` position by submitting an order symbol `BTCUSD` or with new pair convention `BTC/USD`, the position will still be show as `BTCUSD`.

The reasoning behind this is that the position is a sole asset quoted typically in `USD`, whereas pairs are a combination of two assets (with a base and quote currency involve).

    "asset_id": "89691a28-7d5e-46bc-ab11-d5f3bf9ffffc",
