## Supported Assets

Alpaca supports over 20+ unique crypto assets across 52 trading pairs. Current trading pairs are based on BTC, USD, and USDT with more assets and trading pairs coming soon.

To query all available crypto assets and pairs you can you use the following API call,

```bash
curl --request GET 'https://api.alpaca.markets/v2/assets?asset_class=crypto' \
--header 'Apca-Api-Key-Id: <KEY>' \
--header 'Apca-Api-Secret-Key: <SECRET>'
```

Below is a sample trading pair object composed of two assets, `BTC` and `USD`.

```json
{
  "id": "276e2673-764b-4ab6-a611-caf665ca6340",
  "class": "crypto",
  "exchange": "FTXU",
  "symbol": "BTC/USD",
  "name": "BTC/USD pair",
  "status": "active",
  "tradable": true,
  "marginable": false,
  "shortable": false,
  "easy_to_borrow": false,
  "fractionable": true,
  "min_order_size": "0.0001",
  "min_trade_increment": "0.0001",
  "price_increment": "1"
}
```

Note that symbology for trading pairs has changed from our previous format, where `BTC/USD` was previosly referred to as `BTCUSD`. Our API has made proper changes to support the legacy convention as well for backwards compatibility.

For further reference see [Assets API]({{< relref "../api-references/trading-api/assets" >}}).

## Supported Orders

When submitting crypto orders through the [Orders API]({{< relref "../api-references/trading-api/orders" >}}) and the Alpaca web dashboard, Market, Limit and Stop Limit orders are supported while the supported
`time_in_force` values are `gtc`, and `ioc`. We accept fractional
orders as well with either `notional` or `qty` provided.

You can submit crypto orders for a any supported crypto pair via API, see the below cURL POST request.

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/orders' \
--header 'Apca-Api-Key-Id: <KEY>' \
--header 'Apca-Api-Secret-Key: <SECRET>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "symbol": "BTC/USD",
  "qty": "0.0001",
  "side": "buy",
  "type": "market",
  "time_in_force": "day"
}'
```

The above request submits a market order via API to buy 0.0001 BTC with USD (`BTC/USD` pair) that is good till end of day.

To learn more see [orders]({{< relref "/trading/orders.md" >}}) and [fractional trading]({{< relref "/trading/fractional-trading.md" >}}).

All cryptocurrency assets are fractionable but the supported decimal points vary depending on the cryptocurrency. See [Assets entity]({{< relref "../api-references/trading-api/assets.md#asset-entity" >}}) for information on fractional precisions per asset.

Note these values could change in the future.

## Crypto Market Data

Alpaca provides free limited crypto data and a more advanced unlimited paid plan. To learn more on our paid plan or to subscribe see [Alpaca Data](https://alpaca.markets/data).

To request trading pairs data via REST API, see [Crypto Pricing Data REST API Reference]({{< relref "../api-references/market-data-api/crypto-pricing-data/historical.md" >}}).

The example below requests latest orderbook data (bid and asks) for the following three crypto trading pairs: `BTC/USD`, `ETH/BTC` and `ETH/USD`.

```bash
curl --request GET 'data.alpaca.markets/v1beta2/crypto/latest/orderbooks?symbols=BTC/USD,ETH/BTC,ETH/USD' \
--header 'Apca-Api-Key-Id: <KEY>' \
--header 'Apca-Api-Secret-Key: <SECRET>'
```

```json
{
    "orderbooks": {
        "BTC/USD": {
            "a": [
                {
                    "p": 23541,
                    "s": 0.6118
                },
                ...
            ],
            "b": [
                {
                    "p": 23535,
                    "s": 0.0084
                },
                ...
            ],
            "t": "2022-07-19T22:12:18.485428736Z"
        },
        "ETH/USD": { ... }
        },
        "ETH/BTC": { ... }
    }
}
```

Additionally, you can subcribe to real-time crypto data via Websockets. Example below leverages `wscat` to subscribe to `BTC/USD` orderbook.

```bash
 $ wscat -c wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/v1beta2/crypto
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
< [{"T":"success","msg":"connected"}]
> {"action": "auth", "key": "<KEY>", "secret": "<SECRET>"}
< [{"T":"success","msg":"authenticated"}]
> {"action":"subscribe","orderbooks":["BTC/USD"]}
< [{"T":"subscription","trades":[],"quotes":[],"orderbooks":["BTC/USD"],"bars":[],"updatedBars":[],"dailyBars":[]}]

## Crypto Fees

Alpaca stock trading remains commission-free, where crypto trading includes a small fee per trade dependant on volume. See the below table with volume-tiered fee pricing:

| **Tier** | **30d Trading Volume (USD)** | **via Trading API** | **via Dashboard / OAuth** |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1        | 0                            | 25 bps              | 25 bps                    |
| 2        | >500,000                     | 22 bps              | 22 bps                    |
| 3        | >1,000,000                   | 20 bps              | 20 bps                    |
| 4        | >5,000,000                   | 18 bps              | 18 bps                    |
| 5        | >10,000,000                  | 15 bps              | 15 bps                    |
| 6        | >25,000,000                  | 13 bps              | 13 bps                    |
| 7        | >50,000,000                  | 10 bps              | 12 bps                    |
| 8        | >100,000,000                 | 8 bps               | 12 bps                    |

The crypto fee will be charged on the credited crypto asset/fiat (what you receive) per trade. Some examples,

- Buy `ETH/BTC`, you receive `ETH`, the fee is denominated in `ETH`
- Sell `ETH/BTC`, you receive `BTC`, the fee is denominated in `BTC`
- Buy `ETH/USD`, you receive `ETH`, the fee is denominated in `ETH`
- Sell `ETH/USD`, you receive `USD`, the fee is denominated in `USD`

We will be updating this documentation section with instructions on how to obtain fee information programatically via API. For now, fees can be viewed in the web dashboard.
