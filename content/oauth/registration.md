# Register your OAuth app

Before integrating with Alpaca, you'll first need to create a new OAuth app under your [OAuth Apps](https://app.alpaca.markets/brokerage/apps/manage) page. The OAuth Apps page is accessible from the dashboard, which requires you to login to your Alpaca brokerage account to visit.

### Visit OAuth apps on dashboard

To register your app, click the 'OAuth Apps' icon on the left side menu. From here, you can access the apps you have authorized as well as the apps you have developed.

### Create App

Use the "Create New App" flow to register your new application. The first step will be to agree and sign our API Agreement.
